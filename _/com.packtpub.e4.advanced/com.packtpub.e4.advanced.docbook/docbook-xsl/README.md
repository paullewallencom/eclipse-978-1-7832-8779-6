This file is a customised distribution of the DocBook-xsl 1.78.1, which
has been trimmed to remove content not relevant to the generation of
Eclipse help files.

It also includes a minor fix to the eclipse3.xsl stylesheet which fixes
a bug in generating the MANIFEST.MF file; the diff is included and may
be applied upstream or to your own distribution under the same terms
as the docbook-xsl license.
